jQuery Plugin ClickOut
-----------------------------

Those who know jQuery (www.jquery.com) certainly know and appreciate its qualities. For those who do not know, jQuery is a fast and concise JavaScript library that simplifies HTML document traversing, animating, Ajax interactions and event handling.

About event handling, perhaps the most widley used is the "click" event that fires when you click inside the area of a given DOM element.

Sometimes, however, there is the need to handle the event that triggers when you click outsite the area of the DOM element.

To resolve this problem I wrote the plugin ".clickout()"
